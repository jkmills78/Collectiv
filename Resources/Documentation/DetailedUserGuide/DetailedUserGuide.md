# Collectiv

## Detailed User Guide - Example Scenario

This detailed guide will be written using a contrived scenario so that it is easier to understand.  I personally enjoy collecting both video games and antique hand tools.  I'm sure anyone would agree that these are very different collections, and as such will have unique attributes associated with each.  Due to the flexibility of Collectiv, there are different ways you can create your collection, so you may choose to adopt a different structure from what I am exemplifying.

### Create New Collections

First I will create two new entries under collections.  One I will name ```Floppy Disks```, and the other ```Hand Tools```.  So far so good.

#### Click ```Add Collection``` Button

#### Enter New ```Collection Name```

#### Type ```Hand Tools``` and Click the ```Confirm``` Button

### Add Attributes to the First Collection

Since these are different types of things, they will have different important attributes, so I will create those independently for each collection.  I will create three attributes for each collection as an example.  I click on the ```Floppy Disks``` collection header and I see the ```Collection Details``` page.  This is the page that displays your items and files.  I actually need to go a bit further in, so I click on the button for ```Collection Settings```.  This is the page that allows you to create attributes.  For ```Floppy Disks``` I create the attributes ```Platform```, ```Publisher```, and ```Condition```.  Once added these attributes will be added to any existing items in my collection.  I have none yet, so let's continue.

#### Click ```Floppy Disks``` Collection Header

### Add Items

I back out into ```Collection Details```.  This is the page where I can add items and file packages to my collection.  Let's add an item first.  I will name this item ```Loom```.

#### Click the ```Back``` Button

### Set Item Attribute Values

Once I have added the item, I click on its header to enter the ```Item Details``` page.  This page is where I can add file packages for items and any attribute values that I created previously under the collection.  Let's do the attributes first.  I see three attributes listed: ```Platform```, ```Publisher```, and ```Condition```, none of which have any values yet.  I edit each of these to add their proper values.  For ```Platform``` I will put ```PC```.  For publisher, as both of us already know, this will be the venerable ```LucasArts```.  Finally, for ```Condition``` I will say ```Good```.

#### Click ```Loom``` Item Header

#### Enter New ```Attribute Value```

#### Type ```Good``` and Click the ```Confirm``` Button

### Add File Packages

Now I am ready to associate some files with this item.  I could add these associations directly under the ```Collection Details``` page for display in its file gallery at the top with the corresponding items listed out underneath, but I prefer to keep the files inside of the item itself.  I will be adding two ```File Packages``` to the ```Item Details```.  Remember that Collectiv does not store your files, only the locations of those files.  Even in ```Hosted``` mode, the files are simply stored at whatever location you have provided.

I click the button to add a new ```File Package```, and I am directed to the ```File Package Details``` page.  I give it a title of ```Box Contents```.  I then give it a suitably long-winded description, befitting it's name.  I will put ```Stuff that came inside the box```.  I will only use one disk in this example since it will be the same for the rest of the items.  I already have a picture I took of the disk and a backup image (which I will refer to as the .img file from now on since I keep throwing about similar words like picture and image) of the disk itself. I click the button to add a new file and select the picture, then I click the button to add another file and select the .img file.  I am done with this ```File Package```, so now I will click on ```Save```.

#### Click ```Add File Package``` Button

![image](32.png)

#### Enter New ```File Package Name``` and Optional ```Description```

![image](33.png)

#### Type ```Box Contents``` for the ```File Package Name``` and ```Stuff that came inside the box``` for the ```Description```

#### Click ```Add File``` Button

#### Select the ```Loom``` Disk 1 Picture

#### Click ```Add File``` Button

#### Select the ```Loom``` Disk 1 Floppy Image

![image](38.png)

#### Click ```Save``` Button

![image](39.png)

#### The ```Box Contents``` ```File Package``` has been Created

![image](40.png)

This is the one place where you can find a save button rather than a confirmation button.  That's because there are too many things on this page to confirm each, so I just put a save button to save all the things all at once.

Now I add the second and final ```File Package```.  I repeat the steps above, only for the title I put ```Box Art```, for the description I put ```Box art front and back```, I add all associated pictures, and I click on ```Save``` again.

#### The ```Box Art``` ```File Package``` has been Created

### File Gallery

Now in my ```Item Details``` page, I will have the file gallery in the top portion that I can scroll horizontally between to see my two packages: ```Box Contents``` and ```Box Art```.  If I have set one of the picture as primary, then it will be displayed in the gallery as a cover image.  I will see my item attributes set at the bottom of the page for ```Platform PC```, ```Publisher LucasArts```, and ```Condition Good```

#### Set this ```File Package``` as the ```Cover Image```

![image](42.png)

#### Set this ```File``` within the ```Box Art``` Collection as the ```Cover Image```

![image](43.png)

#### ```Cover Image``` Enabled

#### Be Sure to Click the ```Save``` Button when Finished

### Set Different Item Attribute Values

Our first collection has been set up.  Now let's look at the ```Hand Tools```.  This will be much shorter since I have already outlined the steps.  One big difference that I want to point out though, is that while most of the same things can be done in this collection, one step is a bit different.  Gold star for the person who thought "I'm pretty sure hand tools don't have publishers or platforms."  This is where the flexibility begins to shine.  Instead of adding attributes for ```Platform``` or ```Publisher``` to the ```Collection Details```, I will add ```Tool Type``` and ```Manufacturer```, and instead of putting the values ```PC``` and ```LucasArts```, I will put ```Stanley``` and ```No. 5 Jack Plane```.
